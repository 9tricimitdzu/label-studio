## What is Zarzuela?
 
Zarzuela is a Spanish musical theatre genre that combines spoken and sung scenes, with elements of opera, popular songs, folk music, and dance. The name zarzuela comes from the Palace of Zarzuela, a royal hunting lodge near Madrid, where this type of entertainment was first presented to the court in the 17th century[^1^]. Zarzuela has a long and rich history that reflects the diversity and complexity of Spanish culture and society.
 
### The Origins of Zarzuela
 
The first zarzuelas were written in the Baroque period (c. 1630â1750) by playwrights such as Pedro CalderÃ³n de la Barca and Lope de Vega, and composers such as Juan Hidalgo and Antonio de Literes. They were influenced by Italian opera, but also incorporated elements of Spanish poetry, music, and folklore. The plots were often based on classical mythology, history, or legend, and featured a mix of gods, heroes, peasants, and comic characters. The music included lyrical solos (romanzas), choruses, dances, and instrumental interludes. Some examples of Baroque zarzuelas are El laurel de Apolo (The Laurel of Apollo) by CalderÃ³n and Hidalgo (1657), La pÃºrpura de la rosa (The Purple Rose) by CalderÃ³n and Juan de AraÃ±Ã©s (1660), and Acis y Galatea (Acis and Galatea) by Literes (1708).
 
### The Development of Zarzuela
 
In the 18th century, zarzuela declined in popularity due to the preference of the Spanish nobility for Italian and French opera. However, it was revived in the 19th century as a form of Romantic musical theatre that expressed the national identity and aspirations of Spain. Zarzuela became more realistic and contemporary in its themes and characters, and more diverse and regional in its musical styles. Zarzuela also split into two subgenres: gÃ©nero grande (large genre) and gÃ©nero chico (small genre). GÃ©nero grande was a full-length zarzuela with three or four acts, usually set in historical or exotic locations, with a serious or tragic tone. GÃ©nero chico was a one-act zarzuela with a comic or satirical plot, usually set in modern-day Madrid or other urban centers, with a light-hearted or sentimental mood.
