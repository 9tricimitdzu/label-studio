If you are new to Age of Empires Definitive Edition-CODEX, or you want to improve your skills, here are some gameplay tips that might help you:
 
- Choose a civilization that suits your playstyle. There are 35 different civilizations in the game, each with unique bonuses, units, and technologies. Some are better at rushing, some are better at booming, and some are better at defending. Experiment with different civs and find out which one works best for you.
- Scout your map and your enemy. Scouting is essential in Age of Empires Definitive Edition-CODEX, as it gives you valuable information about your surroundings, such as resources, terrain, and enemy location. Use your scout cavalry or eagle warrior to explore the map as soon as possible, and try to find out what your enemy is doing. This will help you plan your strategy and counter their moves.
- Manage your economy efficiently. Your economy is the backbone of your empire, so you need to make sure it is running smoothly and producing enough resources for your needs. Assign your villagers to different resources according to your strategy and the map conditions. For example, if you want to make a lot of archers, you need more wood and gold than food and stone. Also, try to avoid having idle villagers or resource drop-off points that are too far away from the resources.
- Advance through the ages at the right time. Advancing to the next age gives you access to new buildings, units, technologies, and upgrades. However, it also costs resources and time, so you need to decide when is the best time to advance. Generally speaking, advancing too early might leave you vulnerable to enemy attacks, while advancing too late might put you at a disadvantage against a more advanced enemy. A good rule of thumb is to advance when you have enough resources and villagers to support your army and economy.
- Use your home city shipments wisely. One of the unique features of Age of Empires Definitive Edition-CODEX is the home city system, which allows you to receive shipments of units, resources, or cards from your home city every once in a while. These shipments can give you a significant boost in certain situations, but they are also limited and depend on your home city level and deck. Therefore, you need to use them wisely and choose the ones that fit your strategy and situation.

These are just some basic tips for Age of Empires Definitive Edition-CODEX. There are many more advanced strategies and tactics that you can learn by playing the game and watching other players. If you want to learn more about the game mechanics and features, you can also check out the "Art of War" missions in the game, which teach you various aspects of the game in a fun and interactive way.
